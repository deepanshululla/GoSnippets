Here is how we calculate factorial without go routines
```text
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	f := factorial(4)
	fmt.Println("Total:", f)
}

func factorial(n int) int {
	total := 1
	for i := n; i > 0; i-- {
		total *= i
	}
	return total
}

/*
CHALLENGE #1:
-- Use goroutines and channels to calculate factorial

CHALLENGE #2:
-- Why might you want to use goroutines and channels to calculate factorial?
---- Formulate your own answer, then post that answer to this discussion area: https://goo.gl/flGsyX
---- Read a few of the other answers at the discussion area to see the reasons of others

Challenge 3: Factorial with channels
```text
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	c := factorial(4)
	for n := range c {
		fmt.Println(n)
	}
}

func factorial(n int) chan int {
	out := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		total := 1
		for i := n; i > 0; i-- {
			total *= i
		}
		out <- total
		close(out)
	}()
	return out
}

/*
CHALLENGE #1:
-- Change the code above to execute 100 factorial computations concurrently and in parallel.
-- Use the "pipeline" pattern to accomplish this

POST TO DISCUSSION:
-- What realizations did you have about working with concurrent code when building your solution?
-- eg, what insights did you have which helped you understand working with concurrency?
